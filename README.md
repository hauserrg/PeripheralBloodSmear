# Proser: Peripheral Blood Smear Interpretation

This is a peripheral blood smear interpretation support tool designed to improve efficiency and standardization. It generates an initial interpretation based on lab values and provides standardized methods for reporting findings visualized on microscopy.

This repository contains the full code used to implement the tool. An example version of the user-facing web-app has been provided to demonstrate functionality and is described below.

## Demonstration 

The example web-app can be found here: https://ajloza.github.io/PeripheralBloodSmear/

This shows PROSER on example patient data. The lab results fields have been configured to be editable for this demonstration version which allows values to be modified to view the changes in program output. Lab values are **not** editable in the production version but have been made so here to show the range of responses generated by the tool.

### Usage:
  - View responses to lab abnormalities:
    - click on the numeric value of any lab and modify its value to outside the reference range (reference ranges are shown for each lab)
    - after modifying all desired values, click "Reinitialize from Current Values"
  - Add smear findings:
    - use the multiselect dropdown menus to select smear findings
    - use one of the two fillowing methods to add the text to the interpreation
      - 1. Click "Refresh". This will regenerate the complete interpretation text inserting the smear findings in the pre-defined locations, but overwriting any added text.
      - 2. Click "Copy" next to the dropdown menu. This will add the text to the system clipboard allowing the user to insert where desired and preserving any edits.

### Limitations:
 - The ability to edit lab values allows the user to explore the range of responses, but user edited lab values are not validated for internal consistency or physiologic plausibility. Please take this into account when interpreting the output for edited lab values.
 - For example:
   - the differential % values can be modified to sum to greater than 100%
   - The values of hemoglobin and hematocrit are usually highly correlated but could be modified to create non-plausible differences (for example anemia-range hemoglobin with elevated hematocrit)
